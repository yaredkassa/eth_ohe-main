Although the time was difficult and conducive to a life of sin, the saint was waiting for the coming of the Messiah with prayer and hope. At that time, Saint Stephen, who saw John the Baptist preaching the baptism of repentance, he investigated the matter. since he found it to be from God, he became a disciple of John the Baptist. He diligently served Saint John for six months. After learning from Saint John for six months, he bowed to his name and was baptized by our Lord Jesus Christ. St. Stephen, who had sean the great miracle at made by Lord Jesus and taken the lesons to his heart, asked his teacher, St. John, to explain it to him. and St. John said 'you should hear it from the mouth of the Creator rather than from me.' He then sent him to to The holy man went to the Lord and learned with his hands raised. (Luke 7:18) And there he remained a disciple of the Lord.

From this day, the good king worked hard with his army to find the place of the blessed cross. Finally, ten years after his reign, he met Geshen in Ambasal (Wolo) Ethiopia and made him happy.

Ages have passed since he entered a monastery and dedicated his body to God. At that time, the Patriarch of Antioch was resting, so they went around the desert looking for someone who was worthy of the seat. But they never found a better man than St. Athanasius. They brought him to the city because he was a good shepherd who knew the books well and had compassion for his flock. According to the culture of their country, the archbishops are appointed by the bishops of all the dioceses, so they waited. Everyone was present, but Father Ilmefrian, who was the bishop of Selek in Syria, was late. After waiting for fifty days, they appointed Father Athanasios as 'Patriarch of Antioch' and separated. On the fifty-first day, when Father Ilmefrian arrived, he was angry when they told him that the festival was over. 'Anyone who calls Athanasius a patriarch will be damned, for he who is appointed does not work in my absence.' He went back to laughing. St. Athanasius was very sad when he heard this. He did not come seeking the position, but they forced him to do so. Just as we see in his time, the saint can condemn him back. But the saint did not like to see the church and the devotees being divided for the sake of his personal glory. He called his disciple and said, 'My son! Say yes to me, my soul will bless you. I will be on the road for a year, so you  work like me. If the people ask you, tell them that he has gone to the monastery.' after saying that he left the papacy. He walked for a day and arrived in Selek, wearing his very dirty Desert clothes. He went to Abba Ilmefrian and prostrated before him. 'my father! 'I have nothing am passing by, would you allow me stay here?' he begged. Abba Ilmefrian allowed him to live with the monks. St. Athanasius, the patriarch, entered serving with his loins girded. He fetches water, bakes bread, sweeps houses, cleans toilets, washes the monks' feet. With all this, his sweat was dripping down his body. When the fathers saw his diligence and humility, they nominated him for deaconship. The bishop called and said, 'Let me appoint you a deacon.' Patriarch Saint Athanasius cried. 'What?' He said, 'Father! I have been appointed as a deacon before.' then After seven months of noticing him they asked him to be ordained as a priest since he already have been appointed as a deacon and he answered them crying as before that he had already been ordained as a priest. In the same year, they gathered on Sunday to make him a bishop for a diocese. St. Athanasius cried and begged them to leave him. 'You will be up for the position.' But when they insist him more intensively to accept, 'Let me tell you a secret.' He said, 'I am the patriarch Athanasios.' Abba Ilmefrian, who could not believe what he heard, fell on his face in shock. He cried, rolling over. 'Woe to me! I ordered my Patriarch Athanasius as a servant.' He say while crying. Bishops, priests, monks and lay people in the area were completely amazed by St. Athanasius' humble work. They brought the pulpit and carried him around singing. He consecrated the mass and conducted Communion, and there was great joy. The next day, they placed the saint on a beautiful mule, and Abba Ilmefrian traveled on foot (of his own accord) and reached Antioch with great singing. Saint Athanasius, the great shepherd, saved the church from being divided in this way. We celebrate this day becouse the saint died on this day",

According to the teachings of our holy fathers, November 12th is the day when the great angel Saint Michael was appointed as the chief of the powers and tribal angels living in the fourth city of Ior. When God removed Satanel from his power and threw him to the earth because of his pride, Saint Michael was appointed in his place over the 99 tribal angels in the tenth city. (We find that he received this second appointment on April 2nd in our church book called Aximaros.) The appointment of St. Michael is not only on angels; But it also applies to those who are God's people. Among the churches that were planted in Addis Ababa, the first church is located in Shola.

When the time of our father's vacation arrived, on the one hundredth year of his birth, he was separated from this world and then for his strength through the noise of the beasts, the demons, the heat of the day, the cold of the night, and the hunger and thirst. God came with the prophets, apostles, righteous and martyrs and repeated the promise he made to him while he was alive, by saying fo those who called your name, commemorated you, believed in your intercession in your prayers, pleaded with your barren bones in your grave, and entered into your family. He gave them a promise that they will too inherit the kingdom of heaven. Then His pure souls wes separated from his bodies by the hands of angels in the fragrant paradise. The holy angels, in the words of the prophet David, Ps. 116:15, saying, 'A glorious death for the righteous in the presence of God,' took her to her eternal resting place with loud singing, chanting, shouting and life.

As the coming of our Lord is remembered in the month of Pagumen, the hymns that are sung, the verses that are read, and the holy gospel that is also preached, show this mystery. Among the holidays that are remembered and celebrated in the month of Pagumen, every year on the 3rd day of Pagumen, the annual celebration of the Archangel Saint Raphael is celebrated in all Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo churches with a special spiritual ceremony. There are two reasons why the feast of St. Raphael is celebrated. One of them is because of the festival, and the other is the Mass. The meaning of the name 'Raphael' means 'pleasant, kind, merciful, sincere and gentle'. Archangel Raphael is one of the holy angels who constantly praise their creator God. 'I am Raphael, one of the seven noble chiefs' (Tobit 12:15).",

When they were going to a monastery to fulfill their mother's wish, a monk said, 'You are not allowed to be a monk, it is not allowed for you to enter the courtyard of this house, becouse you will ahve a chiled whose prayer is useful to the whole world, whose legacy will be talked about in the whole world since it's clean, who intercedes for the soul on earth, who will see the pulpit.' When the priest said 'God bless us' in the church, he also used to say 'God bless us and forgive us' in his children tongue. When he grew up, apart from learning good manners and keeping the law, he received monkhood at the hands of Father Samuel. When he left Abune Melek Tsadiq Monastery, he prayed for three months in a cave on the road. He also founded the monastery called Sebey, which is 2 hours away from Mount Lebanon, and the mostary is founded and named after him, Augest 26. His birthday is May 26 and He rest on November 26.",

On the 50th day, the Holy Spirit descended upon the apostles while they were praying at the house of this holy mother. Acts 2;1 12;12; This apostle wrote his gospel in Rome in the 11th year of the Lord's reign in the Roman language. Although he followed St. Peter and St. Paul and preached the gospel in various places, he mainly traveled to Egypt and destroyed idols. He came to Ethiopia and preached the gospel. His seat is Alexandria, Egypt. Ethiopia has been importing 111 bishops from Egypt who were appointed by the See of Mark; On April 30th, idolaters killed St. Mark by dragging him with a bull. Let me tell you a little about the city of Debre Markos. After the bishop who was in this city cleansed the church of St. Mark, the country gathers to put in the ark. And the elders stood up and inaugurated the bishop saying, 'God bless you as our father built this parish for us.' But what made them laugh is that God made you a great person. Debar means a mountain.",
